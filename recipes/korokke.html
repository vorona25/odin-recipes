        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Japanese Potato Croquettes, or “Korokke” as they are called in Japanese, is a delicious fried food made from panko-crumbed mashed potato with carrot, onion, and mince. In Japan, these are tasty street food but are also one of those Japanese home-style dishes that can easily be made from scratch.</p>
        <p>Korokke is the Japanese name for potato croquettes. The outside of Korokke is perfect golden-brown that gives a wonderful “Crunch!” sound as you bite into it. And inside is the perfect “hoku hoku” mashed potato with the ultimate ratio of potato to beef mince.</p>
        <p>Japanese Potato Croquettes are served either for lunch or dinner because this little croquette is like an all-in-one-meal.</p>
